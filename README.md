# python-challenge
 Module 3 Challenge

 Before You Begin
Before starting the assignment, be sure to complete the following steps:

Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge. Do not add this homework assignment to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.

In each folder that you just created, add the following content:

A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

A Resources folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure that your script has the correct path to the CSV file.

An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.
